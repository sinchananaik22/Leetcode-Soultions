class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        # Split by spaces (splits on all whitespace) and removes extra spaces
        words = s.split()
        # Reverse the list of words
        words.reverse()
        # Join them with a single space
        return ' '.join(words)




Example Walkthrough
s = "  hello   world  "
words = s.split()  # ['hello', 'world']
words.reverse()    # ['world', 'hello']
result = ' '.join(words)  # "world hello"

Time & Space Complexity

Time → O(n) (splitting + reversing + joining)

Space → O(n) (for list of words)
